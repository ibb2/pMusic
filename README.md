# Rayna

Rayna is a 3rd party music player client for Plex focusing on the desktop experience - Inspired by Spotify.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is currently completely online only and a major work in progress, now running on Electrobun with a React frontend and BASS-backed playback. No separate backend is required. No support yet for offline usage or any advanced caching.

## Installation

### Windows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows on Arm is not natively supported.

1. Download the installer
2. Run the downloaded installer and follow the instructions onscreen.

### MacOS

> [!WARNING]
> All installations on MacOS will need to be whitelisted due to MacOS blocking apps not signed with a paid developer license by default. This is a limitation as I currently do not have a paid Apple developer license.

1. Download the installer.
2. Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag the application to your Applications folder. You will you get a warning saying "Rayna" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin.
3. Open your Terminal app
4. Run the following command:
   `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Rayna.app`
